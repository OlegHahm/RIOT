If you compile RIOT for the native cpu and include the cc110x_ng
module, you need to specify a network interface like this:
./bin/default-native.elf tap0


TAP NETWORKING
==============

There is a shellscript in RIOT/cpu/native called tapsetup.sh which you
can use to create a network of tap interfaces.


Linux
=====

Commands to create / activate / delete Interfaces:
sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user YOURUSERNAME
sudo ip link set tap0 up
sudo ip tuntap del dev tap0 mode tap


OSX
===

For tun/tap networking in OSX you will need:
http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/

Once you installed that, you can follow the steps as outlined in the
"Linux" section.
